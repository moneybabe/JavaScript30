    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let array0 = [1,2,3,4,5];
    let array1 = array0.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let array2 = [].concat(array1);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let array3 = [...array1];   // preferred

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person0 = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person1 = Object.assign({}, person0);
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person0, { name: 'neo', school: 'ucsd' });  // copied person1 to an empty object and overwrite the attributes with { name: 'neo', school: 'ucsd' }

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person4 = {...person0};   // already available 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    /* if only shallow clone, the secondary layer will be passing by reference */
